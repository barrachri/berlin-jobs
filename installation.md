## Installing `Python` and `(mini)conda`
---

[`Python`](http://python.org/) is a popular language for research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well.
You could probably have it already installed but we need some more libraries.

The shorter way to install all of them is to use the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda), is a collection of libraries and a packet manager, an all-in-one installer.

You can find a version for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.

**Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python version 3.6**.

We will teach `Python` using the [`Jupyter Notebook`](http://jupyter.org/), a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all supported (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).
