We love open-source. We are a very international team with interesting people from all over the world (95% of us have relocated to Berlin).How we workWe strongly believe in the importance of uninterrupted time to get stuff done and quality over quantity when it comes to working hours. We prefer to keep our schedule meeting-light and work in a library-like atmosphere during the core hours.We believe the ability to give and get constructive feedback and express divergent ideas is crucial to make innovation come to life. We live a very open discussion culture and prefer the evaluation of ideas based on merit over top-down decision making.We strongly believe in ownership of one's features, from spec to implementation to operation. We also understand that ownership comes with a sense of responsibility towards others that depend on the results of our work.We believe that that everybody should be able to find meaning in their work. We match assignments based on both ability and individual interests and discuss your progress and individual needs every 3 months.We don't see people as ""resources"" and genuinely care about each other. We also understand that there's more than fancy perks and cool events to people's satisfaction and engagement. We continuously work towards an environment providing a lot of autonomy, transparency and development opportunities and rely on everybody's feedback to hold us accountable for maintaining our high standards.About the interview processHow we get to know each otherWe like to start out with a brief 20-30min session for a mutual introduction. We tell you about our company, product and culture and are happy to answer any questions you might have. From your side, we're mostly interested in understanding what kind of challenges you're looking for, what technologies you'd like to work with and what role you'd like to be in.If both sides agree that this could be a good fit, we move on to a more technical session. We ask you to walk us through one of your past projects as if we were new colleagues joining you on the job. The ability to communicate effectively and concisely about complex systems and trade-offs between different approaches is key.In a second technical session, we discuss some of the technologies and concepts you have used. We also give you a walk-through of our product and solutions, discuss our architecture and components. Finally we try to scope your initial role and focus — should you be joining us.In the last session, we discuss the remaining details, logistics and plan your relocation.We see the interview process as a mutual opportunity to get to know each other — at eye level.

KNIME Analytics Platform is popular both with its large and enthusiastic user community as well as IT analysts, who regularly place us in their leaders category  next to some very surprised industry dinosaurs, btw. But we are most proud of the consistently high marks we get for user satisfaction. Our open secret: we are transforming the data-science landscape by providing an open source (and free) platform that lets data scientists mix and match the tools and methods they want while helping enterprises responsibly integrate advanced analytics into their operations. In this way, KNIME helps organizations nurture new user populations that want to exploit the benefits of data science and advanced analytics while remaining strongly committed to open source.Who are you?You like to develop visualizations to help others understand and explore data and have a good amount of experience working with JavaScript frameworks like D3 that are used for building modern interactive visualizations. You have good sense of what it means to make a visualization eye catching without sacrificing usability. Ideally you also have some experience writing java code to massage the (possibly large) data into the right format. If you have a background in doing data analytics / data science thatd even be better, but if not youll learn it.Whats the job?The areas at KNIME you could be working in are manifold. However, you would start by migrating some of the visualization components in KNIME Analytics Platform to JavaScript. That may sound like reworking an existing codebase but its mostly about writing new code  except that we have a bunch of examples to learn from/be inspired by. To get some idea of what this means have look at one of Christians blog posts (though we doubt that he really did it in 10 minutes). This could easily keep you busy for a long, long time but depending on your interest and (our) priorities you might also work on improving the KNIME Webportal, which combines all these standalone views into a powerful application, or -- to take this a bit further -- work with the team bringing the whole KNIME application into the browser. You would be closely working with Oleg, Christian, Greg and Bernd but also be in touch with a lot more folks as in the end your work is of high interest to not only the company but the entire KNIME community.We are looking for someone to join us in one of our offices in Berlin or Konstanz.
