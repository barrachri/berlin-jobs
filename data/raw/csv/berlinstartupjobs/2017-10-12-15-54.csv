ABOUT US
“This startup is set to revolutionize classical music” – Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
We are a technology company that is driven by the mission to build the world’s best streaming service for classical music lovers. We’re the best, because we’re the only service worldwide that is able to offer the specialized search that lovers of this genre want and need. A search that they can’t and won’t get at Spotify, Apple Music or Youtube.
We are honoured to also work directly with the world’s leading musicians and institutions, including the Vienna Philharmonic, the Philharmonia Orchestra and the Israel Philharmonic.
IDAGIO is available to music lovers across the globe, but physically we are rooted in Berlin and consider the German-speaking countries our home base, as the world perceives them as the cradle and the center of classical music.

Our farm management system allows the INFARMers (operators, plant scientists and supervisors) monitor in real time and control the farms via a dashboard and several apps. Reports are available for data-nerds.

More about INFARM:
Our vision stretches until autonomous vertical farms will be spreading through our cities, offering a huge variety of unique, fresh and healthy food in affordable prices. We believe our food system should be decentralised and food production should get closer to the consumer. This is essential in terms of the impact on the environment as well as for significantly improving the safety and quality of our food. Our strategy is to encourage businesses and entrepreneurs to start farming in the city, in supermarkets, restaurants, hotels, co-working spaces, hospitals and even at home, by offering a turnkey solution for indoor farming:
To realise this vision, we developed FaaS™ – Farming as a Service model, in which we sell vertical farms including all farming supplies; seedlings, fertilizers, PH solutions and software services. Our technology allows incomparable efficient use of resources and space, resulting in highly profitable, year round production. INFARM was founded by 3 self-educated farmers and entrepreneurs, who have already gained acclaim in the field of urban farming. They gathered a team of plant scientists, industrial designers, IT wizards, architects, futurists and chefs, all share a passion to help shaping the future of cities.

What you will do:

Full lifecycle engineering: Architecture, solution design, development, quality assurance, shipping, monitoring and maintenance are all done by ourselves in our service oriented platform with currently 70+ restful microservices
Use your brain (a lot): Use your experience, hands-on and can-do attitudes to solve complex problems in the fastest engineering team of 2016 in the vast startup hub of Berlin (1000+ releases last year)
Raise the bar: Our team has a combined professional experience of almost 200 years, averaging at 7.3y per person. Each developer undergoes our coding puzzles to ensure we hire greatest quality. Our culture makes every one of us better every day.
Lead the pack: Small project groups or new permanent teams get kicked off on regular basis. We always need leaders being ready to take over a business unit’s services or provide “POC and delivery” on untouched fields.

What you will learn:

AUTO1 is disrupting the automotive industry. Most of the things we do have never been done before. Every day we are scaling and tuning the core platform and create tools to launch new green field applications
Bleeding edge technology stacks and the drive to always think about the next thing to incorporate without getting bloated. We currently use spring-cloud, java8, postgres 9.4 with jsonb types, elasticsearch and a nice bunch of AWS technologies like ec2, ecs, s3, rds, sqs/sns, elasticache and some lambdas.
Dealing with tons of microservices has it’s own challenges and they require creative approaches.

You are very very smart and can understand complex problems very quickly
You have 5+ years of professional experience in java programming with spring based technologies
You bring at least 1-2 years experience leading a group of developers and taking responsibility for your team and your software. The more the better!
You have deep understanding of the JVM. You are fluid in modern java and know the possibilities of the language and can apply them in every-day or heisenbug scenarios
You have a passionate opinion on how a restful APIs should ideally look like, but you’re not too dogmatic to ignore every-day needs of a business
You’ve seen enough to know that you’re not perfect, but when looking into a mirror you know you’re pretty darn good!

What you will get:

Technical excellence – You will join a high profile and fun engineering team surrounded by technology
Innovative culture – You will work on previously unsolved challenges and experiment with new technologies
Real impact – Your work will enable our business success and disrupt the car industry
Benefits package – You will take advantage of our employee pension scheme, tandem partner program, discounts on different services (gym, public transport, leisure activities…), regular team-events (international nights, bowling, karaoke…)
Smooth start in Berlin – You will receive relocation support that includes assistance with visa, apartment search, moving costs and help with German bureaucracy

Audience Builder enables our customers to set up retargeting campaigns with partners immediately, by defining segmentation rules for the audiences.

This is where we need your help on!
In this role you’ll be taking over services that comprise our Audience Builder product. You will have to dig into the dashboard codebase and make yourself (with our help ofc.) comfortable contributing before you will start to implement your first Audience Builder features and its integration independently.
Integration with third-parties like Facebook and Google is an important part of the Audience Builder and our dashboard backend. You will maintain existing and develop new API backends for a number of our services. Additionally, you’ll be contributing to our dashboard backend services that we are constantly improving and since almost every feature requires dashboard support it needs to be kept up to date.
