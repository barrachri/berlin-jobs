360dialog is a company which believes that awesome technology can solve many of the problems faced by society today. While concentrating at the moment on the real-time marketing field our aim is to create a robust platform which allows the automation of any real-time, event-based activity. We bring in deep data science and machine learning algorithms to minimize the need for human involvement in the day-to-day, leaving them to concentrate on the bigger picture while our platform acts as a never-tired colleague who can take care of all the things too vast or too fast for our meat-bag understanding.
We are based in the no-longer hip Prenzlauer Berg, with sales and operations being run from a penthouse office in the historic Backfabrik and our tech team isolated from the noise in the sprawling basement of the same building. Our mentality is of the ‘work hard, play harder’ variety and we encourage communication rather than isolation as the path to solving problems, working within an agile framework we are constantly looking to improve.
The successful candidate will be part of a team responsible for the technical design and implementation of our real-time, event-based marketing system.
Technology we use:

Mesos+Marathon+Consul and Kubernetes for container orchestration
Aerospike, Clickhouse, PSQL as data warehouse and real-time databases
Kafka and RabbitMQ for internal messaging
Graylog+ES, Prometheus, Grafana and Zabbix for metrics, logging and alerting

A successful candidate would have:

3+ years of experience working with Linux systems in a high-available environment
Experience with container orchestration
Deep knowledge of web infrastructure, distributed systems, databases, and performance analysis
Advanced knowledge of scripting in Bash or Python
Excellent working attitude with a focus on continuously improving the infrastructure

What makes you stand out:

Interest in designing and validating simple and robust solutions
Strong focus on performance analysis and systems reliability
Experience in migrations from bare metal to the cloud
