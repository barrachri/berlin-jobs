Technical Overview:
Our tech team has built a robust service oriented architecture that powers over 20,000 devices – tablets, large format digital touch screens, signage and even a touch projector, courtesy of a special partnership with Sony’s Xperia Touch Team. We power our devices with Android, digging deep into Android OS with our own custom ROMs. We’re primarily a Android/Ruby/Ember shop with some services and node.js and moving some services towards Elixir. We’re running our infrastructure on AWS, currently in dockerized EC2 instances with a home rolled orchestration system, but migrating to ECS. Most of our services are back by PostgreSQL DBs, with some redis and NoSQL sprinkled in where it makes sense. Finally, we use AMQP for as a message bus to tie server communications together.

ABOUT US
“This startup is set to revolutionize classical music” – Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
We are a technology company that is driven by the mission to build the world’s best streaming service for classical music lovers.

IDAGIO is available to music lovers across the globe, but physically we are rooted in Berlin and consider the German-speaking countries our home base, as the world perceives them as the cradle and the center of classical music.
