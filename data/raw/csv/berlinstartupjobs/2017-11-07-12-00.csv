Apache Flink is one of the systems at the forefront of this development, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with data stream processing.
Apache Flink currently powers some of the largest data stream processing pipelines in the world, with users such as Alibaba, Uber, ING, Netflix, and more running Flink in production. Flink is also one of the most active and fastest-growing open source projects in the Apache Software Foundation.
data Artisans was founded in 2014 by the original creators of the Apache Flink project, and we’re building the next-generation platform for real-time data applications. We are tackling some of today’s biggest challenges in big data and data streaming.

Your role:
data Artisans is currently building a new team of Technical Support Engineers in Europe. You’ll be part of a new and fast-growing team helping customers having a great experience using our products and Apache Flink.

You will work with engineering teams of our customers to build the best possible stream processing architecture for their use cases. This includes troubleshooting, giving guidance on how they use their Flink applications, and helping them take their first steps with our products.
And when you’re not working with our customers, there are plenty of opportunities at data Artisans to learn more about Flink, contribute to the products and open source projects, and help evangelizing Apache Flink to users around the world.
What you’ll do all day:

Use your experience to solve data engineering and stream processing problems for our customers and contribute fixes back to our products and/or open source community
Debug issues in the customer use cases and ensure that they are addressed quickly and effectively
Study and understand critical system components and large cluster operations
Participate in occasional on-calls for critical support needs in the future

Become an Apache Flink and stream processing expert
