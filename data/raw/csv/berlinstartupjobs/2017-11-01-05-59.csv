We power our devices with Android, digging deep into Android OS with our own custom ROMs. We’re primarily a Android/Ruby/Ember shop with some services and node.js and moving some services towards Elixir. We’re running our infrastructure on AWS, currently in dockerized EC2 instances with a home rolled orchestration system, but migrating to ECS.
